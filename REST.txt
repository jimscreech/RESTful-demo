REST stands for Representational State Transfer 
ie. a set of guidlines/principles for how clients and servers should communicate with each other.

It is the idea of treating data on the server side as resources that can be CRUD'd; for example a resource could be comments.

The most common way of approaching REST is in formatting URLs and HTTP verns in your apps.

Example CRUD functionality blueprint: 

GET /comments - list all comments
POST /comments - Create a new comments
GET /comments/:id - Gets one comment (using id)
PATCH /comments/:id - Updates one comment
DELETE /comments/:id - Destroys one comment


An example using Comments as a resource: 

Name    Path                Verb    Purpose
Index   /comments           GET     Displays all comments
New     /comments/new       GET     Form to create a new comment
Create  /comments           POST    Creates new comment on server
Show    /comments/:id       GET     Details for one specific comment
Edit    /comments/:id/edit  GET     Form to edit specific comment
Update  /comments/:id       PATCH   Updates specific comment on server
Destroy /comments/:id       DELETE  Deletes specific comment on server
